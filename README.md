# B33-Demo-Search-Engine
[B33](https://b33-se.herokuapp.com/) is a demo search engine which is implement to filter search keyword.


## Why The Search Engine Named 'B33'(Bee)

Bee is one kind of insects who collect honey from different flowers and store. And we can fetch honey from there. Our Search engine works similar to a bee. It manages to find out the core of honey from a large amount of information of any type. And show it to us. That's why we named it 'B33' a.k.a. (Bee).


## Importent Note

1. If your search result shows ***"Oops! Something went wrong"***, Don't worry. It is designed to work that way. Because I don't implement any search engine in the Backend.
2. Though this a responsive website, Some feature will not available on small screen devices.
